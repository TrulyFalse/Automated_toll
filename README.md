# This repo is all about how you can run OCR using CV2 and pytesseract to read a particular image and find out the number plate number and extract the number plate number  onto your console.

How to run this repo>>>>>>>>
make sure your machine has the latest python installed after that download those dependencies accordingly
1. pip install cv2
2. pip install easyocr
3. pip install pytesseract
4. pip install matplotlib

note: change these (pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR/tesseract.exe") to which location you download pytesseract. But i will suggest you to let the machine decide to
download and therefore you need not to change the location path. Try without adding this file also.
